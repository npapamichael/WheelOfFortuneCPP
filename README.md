Objective: Develop a program that simulates the game "Wheel of Fortune" for two players over several rounds. The game should be automated, with outcomes determined by pseudo-random numbers and no user input required.

Implementation Guidelines:

Work on the project individually outside scheduled labs.
Strictly follow the assignment specification to avoid losing marks.
Take precautions to prevent plagiarism and ensure originality in your work.
Learning Outcomes Assessed:

Making informed implementation choices for given problems.
Implementing and documenting a structured program to meet specifications.
Selecting and applying appropriate data structures and algorithms.
Deliverables, Submission, and Assessment:

Program Overview:

The game consists of multiple rounds, each with a hidden word.
Players take turns spinning the wheel of fortune, with outcomes based on the slice rolled.
The game progresses automatically according to specified rules and random numbers.
Program Specification:

Basic Scenario:

Implement basic functionalities such as representing wheel slices, reading data files, and simulating the first round of the game.
Players take turns rolling the wheel, guessing letters, revealing hidden word letters, and experiencing outcomes based on the slice rolled.
Advanced Functionalities:

Store objects dynamically and manage players' earnings and banking amounts.
Implement special actions for different types of slices, such as LoseTurn, Steal, Jackpot, Bankrupt, and SecondChance.
High-Quality Implementation:

Utilize object-oriented methods to ensure clean, efficient, and well-structured code.
Handle edge cases, error handling, and user feedback effectively.
Ensure thorough documentation and adherence to coding standards.
